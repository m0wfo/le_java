Account Setup
-------------
You can sign up for a Logentries account simply by clicking Sign Up and entering your email address. Once you have your credentials and have logged in,
create a new host in the UI with a name that represents your app. Then, select this host and create a new logfile with a name that represents what you're
logging. Select 'TOKEN TCP' as the source_type and click Register to create the log.
